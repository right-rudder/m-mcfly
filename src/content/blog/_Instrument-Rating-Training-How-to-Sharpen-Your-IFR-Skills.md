> Instrument flying is all about **precision, situational awareness, and confidence**.

## Why IFR Training Matters

- Enables flying in **low visibility** safely.
- Expands the range of conditions you can fly.
- Builds skills that improve overall airmanship.

## Core Training Approaches

- **Simulator sessions** for instrument approaches, holds, and emergency scenarios.
- **Scenario-based cross-country flights** under IFR conditions.
- Step-by-step review of each approach and missed approach procedure.

## Key Levers for Success

### 1. Short Feedback Loops

Debrief each approach immediately; correct errors before habits form.

### 2. Ground Briefings

Review **approach charts, ATC communication, and procedures** before flying.

### 3. Full-Flight Simulations

Practice complete IFR flights including departures, enroute, holds, approaches, and arrivals.

## Tracking Progress

- Record flight hours, approaches, holds, and errors.
- Identify trends and target weak areas.
- Update next lesson plan based on prior performance.

## Ready for the skies?

Structured, hands-on IFR training accelerates learning while maintaining **maximum safety and confidence**.
