### 2. ✅ Added Article Schema to Blog Posts

**Objective:** Implement structured data for blog articles to enable rich snippets in search results.

**File Modified:** `/src/pages/blog/[slug].astro`

**Schema Library Updated:** `/src/lib/schema.js`
- Already had `createBlogPostingSchema()` function
- Now actively used on all blog post pages

**Implementation:**
```astro
import { createBlogPostingSchema } from "../../lib/schema.js";

// Generate Article schema for blog post
const articleSchema = createBlogPostingSchema({
  title: e.data?.title || "Blog Post",
  description: e.data?.description || "",
  image: e.data?.heroImage
    ? `https://mcflyeducation.com/src/assets/stock/${e.data.heroImage}`
    : "https://mcflyeducation.com/images/hero-homepage.jpg",
  pubDate: pubDate.toISOString(),
  updatedDate: e.data?.updatedDate
    ? new Date(e.data.updatedDate).toISOString()
    : pubDate.toISOString(),
  author: e.data?.author || "Marty McFly",
  url: `https://mcflyeducation.com/blog/${e.slug}/`,
});

<Fragment slot="head">
  <script type="application/ld+json" set:html={JSON.stringify(articleSchema)} />
</Fragment>
```

**Schema Structure:**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BlogPosting",

  },
  "mainEntityOfPage": {

  }
}
```

- Rich snippets eligibility in Google search results
- Better content understanding by search engines

### 3. ✅ Added Review/AggregateRating Schema Infrastructure

**Objective:** Prepare schema structure for future student testimonials and reviews.

**File Modified:** `/src/lib/schema.js`

**New Functions Added:**

#### `createAggregateRatingSchema(reviews)`
```javascript
export function createAggregateRatingSchema(reviews) {
  if (!reviews || reviews.length === 0) {
    return null;
  }

  const totalRating = reviews.reduce((sum, review) => sum + review.rating, 0);
  const averageRating = totalRating / reviews.length;

  return {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "LocalBusiness",
    "@id": "https://mcflyeducation.com/#organization",
    "aggregateRating": {
      "@type": "AggregateRating",
      "ratingValue": averageRating.toFixed(1),
      "reviewCount": reviews.length,
      "bestRating": "5",
      "worstRating": "1"
    },
    "review": [...]
  };
}
```

#### `createReviewSchema(review)`
```javascript
export function createReviewSchema(review) {
  return {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Review",
    "itemReviewed": {
      "@type": "LocalBusiness",
      "name": "McFly Education",
      "@id": "https://mcflyeducation.com/#organization"
    },
    "author": {
      "@type": "Person",
      "name": review.authorName
    },
    "datePublished": review.date,
    "reviewBody": review.text,
    "reviewRating": {
      "@type": "Rating",
      "ratingValue": review.rating,
      "bestRating": "5",
      "worstRating": "1"
    }
  };
}
```

**Usage Example (when reviews are available):**
```astro
import { createAggregateRatingSchema } from "../lib/schema.js";

const reviews = [
  {
    authorName: "John Doe",
    date: "2025-10-01",
    text: "Excellent flight training!",
    rating: 5
  },
  // ... more reviews
];

const ratingSchema = createAggregateRatingSchema(reviews);

<Fragment slot="head">
  <script type="application/ld+json" set:html={JSON.stringify(ratingSchema)} />
</Fragment>
```

**Future Benefits:**
- Star ratings in Google search results
- Trust signals with review count display
- Competitive advantage over schools without reviews
- Social proof in search listings

**Action Required:** Collect student testimonials/reviews to activate this feature
