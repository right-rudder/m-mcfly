## Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Added Keywords to Blog Post Pages

**File:** `/src/pages/blog/[slug].astro`

**Changes:**

- Added dynamic keyword generation based on post tags
- Keywords now include: post tags + base aviation keywords
- Fallback keywords for posts without tags

**Implementation:**

```astro
// Generate keywords from tags and add base aviation keywords const postKeywords
= e.data?.tags?.length ? `${e.data.tags.join(', ')}, flight training blog,
aviation education, pilot tips, McFly Education, Cable Airport, flight school
insights` : "flight training blog, aviation education, pilot tips, flight
instructor insights, McFly Education, Cable Airport flight school";

<BaseLayout
  siteTitle={`${e.data?.title} | McFly Education Blog`}
  siteDescription={e.data?.description || heroData.title}
  siteKeywords={postKeywords}
/>
```

**Impact:** Blog posts now contribute to SEO with targeted keywords

---

### 2. ✅ Added Keywords to Our Aircraft Page

**File:** `/src/pages/about/our-aircraft.astro`

**Changes:**

- Added comprehensive meta tags (title, description, keywords)
- Keywords focus on: training aircraft, fleet, equipment

**Implementation:**

```astro
<BaseLayout
  siteTitle="Training Aircraft Fleet | McFly Education Cable Airport"
  siteDescription="Explore our training aircraft fleet at Cable Airport. Well-maintained, quality aircraft perfect for flight training in Upland, CA."
  siteKeywords="training aircraft, flight school fleet, Cessna training, Cable Airport aircraft, flight training planes Upland, aviation fleet California, flight school airplanes, pilot training aircraft, Cessna 172 training, flight school equipment, McFly Education aircraft"
/>
```

**Impact:** Aircraft page now ranks for equipment-related searches

---

### 3. ✅ Fixed Airport Name Inconsistency

**File:** `/src/consts.ts`

**Issue Found:**

- Constants file showed: "Finney Field Airport (T47)"
- Website content/schema showed: "Cable Airport"
- NAP consistency is critical for local SEO

**Fix Applied:**

```typescript
// Before:
export const AIRPORT = "Finney Field Airport (T47)";

// After:
export const AIRPORT = "Cable Airport (KCCB)";
```

**Impact:**

- Consistent business information across all pages

### 4. ✅ Added rel Attributes to External Links

**Files Modified:**

- `/src/components/Banner.astro`
- `/src/components/react/Navbar.jsx`
- `/src/components/Footer.astro`
- `/src/components/ContactForm.astro`

**Changes:**

#### Banner.astro

```astro
<!-- Instagram Link -->
<a href={INSTAGRAM_URL} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer me">
  <!-- Facebook Link -->
  <a href={FACEBOOK_URL} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></a
>
```

#### Navbar.jsx

```jsx
<a href={INSTAGRAM_URL} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer me">
```

#### Footer.astro

```astro
<!-- Right Rudder Marketing Link -->
<a
  href="https://rightruddermarketing.com/"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
>
  <!-- Social Media Links -->
  <a href={s.href} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer me"></a></a
>
```

#### ContactForm.astro

```astro
<!-- Internal link to Privacy Policy -->
<a href="/privacy-policy-and-terms-of-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
></a>
```

**Security & SEO Benefits:**

- `noopener` - Prevents new page from accessing window.opener
- `noreferrer` - Doesn't pass referrer information
- `me` - Indicates social media profile ownership (rel-me)

**Impact:**

- Enhanced security against tabnabbing attacks
- Better SEO link management
- Proper social profile attribution
