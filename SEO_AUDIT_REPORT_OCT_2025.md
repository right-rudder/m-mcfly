  },

}
```

  "publisher": { "@id": "https://mcflyeducation.com/#organization" }
}
```

### Recommendations:

- ✅ `certified-flight-instructor.md`

**Frontmatter Schema:**
```yaml
title: "Private Pilot License (PPL)"
shortTitle: "Private Pilot"
tagline: "Your first step to pilot in command."
level: "Beginner"
durationWeeks: "12–24 weeks"
minFlightHours: "Minimum 40 hours"
heroImage: { src: "...", alt: "..." }
summary: "..."
stats: { programLength: "...", flightHours: "..." }
structure: [...]
benefits: [...]
entryRequirements: [...]
assessments: [...]
```

**Dynamic Keyword Generation:** ✅ EXCELLENT

const postKeywords = e.data?.tags?.length
  ? `${e.data.tags.join(", ")}, flight training blog, aviation education, pilot tips...`
  : "flight training blog, aviation education, pilot tips..."
```

### Recommendations:
1. **Fix markdown linting issues** in `sample.md`:

import sitemap from "@astrojs/sitemap";

export default defineConfig({
  site: "https://mcflyeducation.com/",
  integrations: [
    mdx(),
    sitemap({
      filter: (page) => {
        return (
          !page.includes("confirmation") &&
          !page.includes("/404") &&
          !page.includes("/500")
        );
      },
      changefreq: "weekly",

```
